# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Mazerunner

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game where the user has to go through the mazes to win

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will allow the user to move around the maze using keyboard commands. The project will look aesthetically pleasing. The project will be executed using loops, expressions, and functions. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The game is playable

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game has an appealing design

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game will utilize the keyboard functions to allow the cursor to move. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Review on loops, expressions, and functions. Look up code to utilize keyboard functions, as well as how to import imagery and/or create shapes to allow for an appealing design. Work will be equally distributed.
